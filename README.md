# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java - The Teaching Chronicles (December 2023)

Hey there, code adventurers! 🎉

Welcome to the treasure trove of Java code from my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course, which I had the absolute pleasure of teaching in December 2023. This was a week-long coding extravaganza with a group of bright post-high school students, and I’m stoked to share the code that helped us dive into the world of DSA while having a ton of fun!

## 📝 Course Rundown

In December 2023, I embarked on a fantastic journey, teaching a group of eager post-high school students all about data structures and algorithms using Java. Our mission? To turn complex concepts into exciting, hands-on experiences and spark a lifelong love for coding. Spoiler alert: It was a blast!

## 🛠️ Cool Stuff We Covered

- **Java Basics:** We kicked things off with a refresher on Java fundamentals—perfect for setting the stage.
- **Hands-On Coding:** Packed the week with practical coding exercises to reinforce learning.
- **Interactive Fun:** Focused on interactive learning and solving real-world problems.
- **Curiosity Booster:** Aimed to ignite curiosity and passion for software development.

## 💻 Tech We Played With

- **Java:** The trusty language we used for all our coding escapades.
- **Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA:** Our favorite IDEs—because coding should be fun and efficient!
- **JUnit:** Essential for those all-important unit tests to keep our code running smoothly.

## 📚 Code Samples

### Arrays & Strings

- **Array Magic:** Java code snippets for essential array operations.
- **String Shenanigans:** Exercises focused on mastering string manipulation.

### Linked Lists

- **Linked List 101:** Code for both singly and doubly linked lists.
- **List Operations:** Methods for inserting, deleting, and traversing linked lists.

### Stacks & Queues

- **Stack Overflow (Not the site!):** Implementations of stack operations.
- **Queue Up:** Examples of queue operations and their implementations.

### Trees & Graphs

- **Tree of Knowledge:** Java code for building and traversing binary trees.
- **Graph Adventures:** Examples of graph traversal algorithms like DFS and BFS.

### Sorting & Searching Algorithms

- **Sort It Out:** Implementations of bubble sort, merge sort, and quicksort.
- **Search Party:** Code for binary search and other searching techniques.

## 🚀 How to Dive In

- **Explore the Code:** Check out the provided Java code examples and exercises.
- **Learn & Play:** Use the code to follow along with the DSA concepts covered in the course.
- **Experiment:** Feel free to tweak and expand the code to deepen your understanding.

## 🙏 Shoutouts

A huge thank you to the amazing students who made this course a memorable experience, and to my neighborhood friends who supported me throughout this volunteer adventure. Your enthusiasm and dedication were truly inspiring!

Feel free to explore the code, drop me a line if you have questions, or just share your own coding journeys. Let’s keep the coding spirit alive! 🚀

Happy coding and may your algorithms always be efficient! 💡
